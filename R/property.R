#' Hedgehog property test
#'
#' Check a property holds for all generated values.
#'
#' The generator used can be defined flexibly, in that
#' one can pass in a list of generators, or even nest
#' generators and constant values deeply into the gen
#' argument and the whole construct will be treated
#' as a generator.
#'
#' @param generator a generator or list of generators
#'   (potentially nested) to use for value testing.
#' @param property a function which takes a value from
#'   from the generator and tests some predicated against
#'   it.
#' @param tests the number of tests to run
#' @param size.limit the max size used for the generators
#' @param shrink.limit the maximum number of shrinks to
#'   run when shrinking a value to find the smallest
#'   counterexample.
#' @param discard.limit the maximum number of discards to
#'   permit when running the property.
#' @param curry whether to curry the arguments passed
#'   to the property, and use do.call to use the list
#'   generated as individual arguments.
#'   When curry is on, the function arity should be the
#'   same as the length of the generated list.
#'   Defaults to \code{T} if the input is a list.
