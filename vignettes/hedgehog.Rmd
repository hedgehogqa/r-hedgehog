> Hedgehog will eat all your bugs.

Hedgehog is a modern property based testing system, originally
written in Haskell, but now also ported to R. One of the key benefits
of hedgehog is integrated shrinking of counterexamples, which allows
one to quickly find the cause of bugs, given salient examples of
incorrect behaviour.

Features
========

- Integrated shrinking, shrinks obey invariants by construction.
- Generators can be combined to build complex and interesting
  structures
- Abstract state machine testing.

Example
=======

To get a quick feel for how hedgehog feels, here's a quick example
showing some of the properties a reversing function should have.
We'll be testing the `rev` function from included in package:base.

```{r echo = T, message = F}
forall( gen.c( gen.sample(1:100) ), function(xs) identical ( rev(rev(xs)), xs))
```

The property above tests that if I reverse a vector twice, the
result should be the same as the vector that I began with.
Hedgehog has generated 100 examples, and check that this predicate
holds in all of these cases.

We use the term forall (which comes from predicate logic) to say
that we want the property to be true no matter what the input to
the `rev` function is. The first argument to forall is function
to generate random values (the generator); while the second is
the property we wish to test.

The property above doesn't actually completely specify that the
`rev` function is accurate though, as one could replace rev with
the identity function and still observe this result. We will therefore
write one more property to completely test this function.


```{r echo = T, message = F}
forall( list( as = gen.c( gen.sample(1:100) )
            , bs = gen.c( gen.sample(1:100) ))
      , function(as,bs) identical ( rev(c(as, bs)), c(rev(bs), rev(as)))
)
```

This is now a well tested reverse function. Notice that the property
function now accepts two arguments: `as` and `bs`. A list of
generators in hedgehog is treated as a generator of lists, and
shrinks like one. We do however do our best to make sure that
properties can be specified naturally if the generator is specified
as a list of generators.

Now let's look at an assertion which isn't true so we can see what a
counterexamples looks like

```{r echo = T, message = F}
forall( gen.c( gen.sample(1:100) ), function(xs) identical ( rev(xs), xs))
```

This test says that the reverse of a vector should equal the vector,
which is obviously not true for all vectors. Here, the counterexample
is shrunk from an original test value. The smallest possible value
for which this doesn't hold is shown to the user.

Generators
==========

Hedgehog exports some basic generators and plenty combinators for
making new generators. Here's an example which produces a floating
point value between -10 and 10, shrinking to the median 0.

```{r echo = T, message = F}
gen.unif( from = -10, to = 10 )
```

Although only three possible shrinks are shown above, these are
actually just the first layer of a rose tree or possible shrinks.
This integrated shrinking property is a key component of hedgehog,
and gives us a substantial change of reducing to a minumum possible
counterexample.

```{r echo = T, message = F}
forall( gen.unif( from = -10, to = 10 ), function(a) a < 0.1)
```

The generators `gen.c`, `gen.sample`, and `gen.unif`, are related to
the R functions `c`, to create a vector; `sample` to sample from a
list or vector; and `runif`, to sample from a uniform distribution.
We try to maintain a relationship to R's well known functions inside
Hedgehog.

Generators are also monads, meaning that one can use the result of a
generator to build a generator. An example of this is a list generator,
which first randomly chooses a length, then builds a list of said
length.

The `gen.map` function can be used to apply an arbitrary function to
the output of a generator, while `gen.with` is useful in chaining the
results of a generator.

```{r echo = T, message = F}
forall(
  gen.map (
    as.data.frame,
    list( as = gen.c.of(5, gen.sample(1:10) )
        , bs = gen.c.of(5, gen.sample(10:20) )
        )
    )
  , function(df) nrow(df) == 5)
```

State Machine Testing
=====================

R is a multi-paradigm programming language, while all the tests we
have seen so far have tested functions which have no side effects
(pure functions).

To deal with more complex situations which might arise in practice,
Hedgehog also supports testing stateful system using a state machine
model under random actions.

John Hughes has a serious of excellent [talks][jh-dropbox] regarding
testing of state based and non-deterministic systems using QuviQ's
proprietary QuickCheck implementation, which has been using these
techniques to great effect for many years.

Hedgehog's current implementation in R is still quite young, and
not as fully fledged, but does still allow for interesting properties
in stateful systems to be investigated.
