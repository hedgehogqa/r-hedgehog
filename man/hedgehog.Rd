\title{Property based testing in R}
\description{
Hedgehog is a modern property based testing
system in the spirit of QuickCheck, originally written in Haskell,
but now also available in R.
}
\details{
Software testing is critical when we want to distribute our
work, but unit testing only covers examples we have thought of.

With hedgehog (integrated into testthat), we can instead test properties
which our programs and functions should have, and allow automatic
generation of tests, which cover more that we could imagine.

One of the key benefits of Hedgehog is
integrated shrinking of counterexamples, which allows one to quickly
find the cause of bugs, given salient examples when incorrect
behaviour occurs.

\section{Options}{

- `hedgehog.tests`: Number of tests to run in each property
    (Default: `100`).

- `hedgehog.size`: Maximum size parameter to pass to generators
    (Default: `50`).

- `hedgehog.shrinks`: Maximum number of shrinks to search for
    (Default: `100`).

- `hedgehog.discards`: Maximum number of discards permitted
    within a property test before failure
    (Default: `100`).
}
\examples{
library(hedgehog)
test_that( "Reverse and concatenate symmetry",
  forall( list( as = gen.c( gen.sample(1:100) )
              , bs = gen.c( gen.sample(1:100) ))
        , function( as, bs )
            expect_identical ( rev(c(as, bs)), c(rev(bs), rev(as)))
  )
)
