\title{Generate a structure}
\usage{
gen.structure(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object generator which will have various attributes attached to it.}

\item{...}{attributes, specified in ‘tag = value’ form, which will be
attached to generated data.}
}
\description{
If you can create an object with `structure`,
you should be able to generate an object with
this function from a generator or list of
generators.
}
\details{
gen.structure accepts the same forms of data
as forall, and is flexible, in that any list
of generators is considered to be a generator.
}
\examples{
# To create a matrix
gen.structure( vec.of(6, gen.sample(1:30)), dim = 3:2)

# To create a data frame for testing.
gen.structure (
  list ( vec.of(4, gen.sample(2:10))
       , vec.of(4, gen.sample(2:10))
       , c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
       )
  , names = c("a","b", "constant")
  , class = "data.frame"
  , row.names = c("1", "2", "3", "4" ))
